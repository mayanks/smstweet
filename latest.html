        xAuth is a modification to OAuth protocol to allow browser less access to OAuth tokens. OAuth redirects users to twitter to let users allow an application get access to a users. This way the application need not store the password of their users. But on the other hand it creates a problem when user register through their mobile phone. In that case there is no browser and hence no redirection to twitter page to grant access. But just a couple of days ago, <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method:-oauth-access_token-for-xAuth">Twitter released a restricted access to xAuth</a> which allows access to the tokens using username and password. We got SMSTweet registered for xAuth and now all users irrespective of how they registered, are on OAuth.
